# Al-Ahly-Stats-in-Fifa-CWC25
This project analyzes the performance of the Egyptian football team and its players in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, which was held in USA.
The dataset used in this project was imported from footystats: https://footystats.org/international/fifa-club-world-cup

This data was filtered and cleaned to suit the needed outcomes of this project, using MS Excel. The next phase was analyzing the data and doing some wrangling and derive calculations using python, which is available in this repo. 
The final phase of the project is the visualization part, which was done by using Tableau Desktop, you can check the vizzes through my profile: http://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mostafa.helmy/vizzes
